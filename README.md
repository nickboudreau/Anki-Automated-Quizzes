This is a fork of https://github.com/colecostanza/Anki-Automated-Quizzes for my own personal use.

main differences are 
- ability to choose Card types (new/learn/due/review)
- slight re-organizing of the menu to include Card types
- some minor UI preference changes like increasing the font size of the questions, and the styling of the questions
